    // 1) If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?
    let mentor = "Christophe Drayton";
    
    
    // 2) How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?
    console.log(mentor);

    // 3) Describe the difference between let, var, and const?

    // const = a constant unchangeable value, its like final in java
    // let = is a variable that is changeable 
    // var = is the same as let but older and it hated by the community apparently, 
    //        there is a difference in scope of the variable with let, but i dont know that

    // 4) Using var, let and const create 3 variables that will hold your name, state, and hair color?
    const name = 'Richard';
    let state = 'Texas';
    var hairColor = "blue";
