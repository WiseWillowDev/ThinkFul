            <h1>Beyonce.com: what the lawsuit tells us about the State of UX</h1>

                2019 started strong for accessibility when Dan Shaked, a NYC attorney, filed a class action lawsuit against Parkwood Entertainment LLC, owner of  beyonce.com, website of the singer. Mary Conner, the Plaintiff, who is visually impaired and legally blind, was unable to navigate the website easily to purchase tickets for the upcoming event of the artist.

                    Regine Gilbert is a user experience designer, educator, and international public speaker with over 10 years of experience working in the technology arena. She has a strong belief in making the world a more accessible place—one that starts and ends with the user.

                    One could argue that the plaintiff had plenty of options to go and purchase tickets, on websites that are way more accessible. Indeed, usability research tend to prove that users just leave a website when they can't find it anything useful, and finalize their purchase onto another one. But not in that case.
                    The time invested in proceeding with the task of finding the information has value. In this case, it is more than about usual lack of alternative text on images, or inaccessible navigation: it is about a commodity. Buying a ticket for a Bey concert as a blind user requires a sighted companion. Otherwise you might end up paying the full price, as neither shipping banner nor the discount code field are read by a screen reader.
                    Not offering an accessible way to do so is therefore a denial of service. It is equal to Beyonce stating that she doesn't want disabled people to attend her concerts. It strongly contrasts with her inclusion of a wheelchairbond model in her new merchandise campaign two years ago.
                    However, beyond the PR nightmare, this lawsuit sheds light on one of the biggest issue on our industry: UI trends.
                    According to Wayback Machine, the actual design was released in late April 2014. Interestingly enough, two months before, Jonathan Meades released a documentary on Brutalism design. It was followed by articles in the web industry about “what web designers can learn from Brutalism”, or about what they can “really learn from brutalist architecture”.

                <!-- the really Strong text in the middle of the screen -->
                The overall idea of brutalism is to get rid off all the codes and visual principles of the industry and to keep raw information by being bold and transgressive. It comes from the Post-WWII era, where architects challenged the fragile 1930s-40s design.

                With the On the Run Tour, the first co-headlining stadium tour with her husband in 2014, brutalism might have sounded like the best PR choice at the time. But this is where the analogy stops.
                    Brutalism takes its roots from a heavily damaged landscape, at a time where the cost of rebuilding was high. Therefore, it is an economy choice.

                    In this particular case, the designer made the economy of best guidelines of the industry over a visual choice, making this lawsuit the epitome of the phenomenon. Over and over, as soon as a new trend is released, we can witness it to be celebrated, and to win awwwards.
                    Unfortunately, designers often forget that websites are all but representation of their art: websites are marketing tools, serving a brand to sell to a target. And on a screen, the real clients are the final users.
                    It was long coming that Federal Law has to protect web users the same way they do with real brick-and-mortar ones: when a client is denied service, simply based on a disability, it is discrimination. It backfires and hurts the brand. And when you’re a Queen Bee, it stings. 
                    Some quick and consistent fixes could help though, despite ever new UI trends. Research show that user behavior actually doesn't change quite rapidly over the years.

                        Usability tells us users need a anchored navigation, spotting where they are at any given moment, easily accessible if we want to browse to another page;

                        Cognitive psychology recommends for images to have captions, for layouts to be uncluttered, and for the ratio visual:text to be balanced in order to reduce the cognitive load (ie the time we spend understanding a new information).  
                </li>
                <li>
                        W3C, and the Law, tell us that code should be optimized to be interpreted by accessible technology.

                    These are the barebones of any successful experience: it drives traffic, increases revenues, and bring back customers.
                    But it is our responsibility, also, as citizen architects of the Web, to design more inclusively, and to demonstrate the marketing value of accessibility to the brands we are working with.
